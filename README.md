 Erinium Adventure's mods

## Erinium Jobs
This mod is enterly configurable ! You can add block and item to earn XP and set a level requirement between 0 and 100 for blocks and item !
### Custom Jobs
By default, you have 4 jobs, miner, farmer, hunter and alchimist.
You can add custom jobs by adding json file at location : GAMEFOLDER/config/EriniumJobs/jobs/job_id.json

‚ö†Ô∏è You cant delete the fourth default jobs !
How the file is constructed : 
```json
{
	"displayname": "DISPLAYNAME"
}
```

### Earn XP
To add a block or item to earn money go to these location : 
GAMEFOLDER/config/EriniumJobs/EarnXp/MODID/ID.json

The file must be a json file like iron_ingot.json
Here the json parameter : 
```json
{
	"job_id": "JOB_ID",
	"min-level": LEVEL,
	"max-level": LEVEL,
	"type": "TYPE",
	"xp": XP
}
```
- job_id is the job you earn (one job only !)
- min level is the minium level to start to earn xp
- max level is the max level to earn xp (after you dont earn)
- type is the type here an example :

		- BREAK (When you break block)
		- EAT (When you eat / drink)
		- SMELTED (An item smelted ‚ö†Ô∏èRESULT ITEM*)
		- CRAFTED (An item crafted ‚ö†Ô∏èRESULT ITEM*)
  		- KILL (Kill an entities)

\* For example, for diamond, on BREAK you set diamond_ore and on SMELTED you set diamond
- xp is the amount of XP is given (more you will levelup, you will earn less xp) see my [excel](https://1drv.ms/x/s!Aq5o6W9h7OB9gYExyFZm1cFhJ0n0EA?e=Ko20vF "excel") to understand

üí°XP multiplier and Won XP Multiplier are fully customisable here : GAMEFOLDER/config/erinium-ranking.toml

üí°You can set multiple type like that : "BREAK, EAT, CRAFTED" but generaly you don't need to set multiple type but why not

Here an example for diamond_ore and diamond
location : GAMEFOLDER/config/EriniumJobs/EarnXp/minecraft/diamond_ore.json
```json
{
	"job_id": "miner",
	"min-level": 0,
	"max-level": 45,
	"type": "BREAK",
	"xp": 125
}
```
location : GAMEFOLDER/config/EriniumJobs/EarnXp/minecraft/diamond.json
```json
{
	"job_id": "miner",
	"min-level": 0,
	"max-level": 65,
	"type": "SMELTED",
	"xp": 160
}
```

### Require Level

GAMEFOLDER/config/EriniumJobs/Required/MODID/ID

```json
